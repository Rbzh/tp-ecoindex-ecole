                        <p>Ecoindex.fr is an online service designed and offered by
                            Frédéric Bordage (Greenit.fr) and directed by Gwenael Chailleu and Thomas Samain of the
                            company NXTWEB.</p>
                        <p>This service aims to identify the environmental impact of a
                            website.
                            It provides the user several indicators:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The famous Ecoindex: environmental performance (100
                                score, Higher is Better)
                            </li>
                            <li>A note from A to G reflecting this performance</li>
                            <li>Its technical imprint (weight, complexity)</li>
                            <li>Its environmental footprint (greenhouse gas,
                                water)
                            </li>
                            <li>A list of good practice as well as an assessment of
                                respect for it
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The objective of the service is an awareness of the
                            environmental impact of digital services, as well as the concrete tracking proposal.</p>

                        <h3>Technical imprint</h3>
                        <p>The technical footprint of a site is represented by
                            several indicators:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The size of the DOM: This indicator makes it
                                possible to assess the complexity of a website.
                                The greater the DOM, the more it will need power and memory for its load as well as for
                                all operations concerning it.
                            </li>
                            <li>The loaded file weight: This indicator assesses the
                                impact of the loading of the website on the network.
                                The more heavy the files will be the more they will require network resources.
                            </li>
                            <li>The number of requests made to loading the page:
                                this indicator allows you to assess how much the loading of the page requires servers.
                                This number allows the consumption of servers to be interpolated.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The environmental footprint is broken down into two
                            points</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Greenhouse gas emission, measured in equivalent CO2

                        </ul>
                        <p>These values come from an estimate taking into account all
                            the actors (customer, network and server), and are based on an analysis of the life cycle of
                            the different devices.</p>

                        <h3>Good practices</h3>
                        <p>The CNUMR offers a good practice list for web platform
                            design.
                            Certain points on this list can be tested automatically during the platform analysis.</p>
                        <p>A non-exhaustive list of good practices tested:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of JavaScript plugin used.</li>
                            <li>The number of CSS files.
                                It can be useful to cut your CSS into several specialized files.
                                This cut can be made according to a functional logic (general content, page A, page B,
                                etc.) or a query media logic (a "print" page for example).
                                The browser will immediately load the necessary page, and that not necessary with a very
                                low priority.
                                Be careful, however, that the cutouts are relevant (less than a dozen files).
                            </li>
                            <li,
                                that is to say in the body of HTML.
                                Their presence in HTML makes the site more difficult to maintain.
                                Note for JavaScript: often analytics tools add these loads to loading, in this case
                                nothing can be done about them.
                            </li>
                            <li>The number of empty src attribute.
                                Certain browser (chrome and safari) manages this scenario badly, and make an additional
                                request to the URL on the page to load this image.
                                As explained here, a good way to leave an empty source is to pass the attribute to SRC =
                                "data:,".
                            </li>
                            <li>And around twenty other indicators.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For an exhaustive list, I invite you to take a look at the

                        <h3>The Ecoindex an end in it?</h3>
                        <p>Is a good eco-is eco-responsible page?
                            The Ecoindex is a good indicator, but it is often necessary to go further in an eco -design
                            process.
                            For example, the Ecoindex does not allow you to test the functional sobriety of a website.
                            Indeed, to test the Ecoindex you must have developed the application, so sobriety decisions
                            must already be taken.</p>
                        <p>It will also be noted that the Ecoindex does not take into
                            account certain performance indicators, but a site with poor performance will generate a
                            feeling of obsolescence felt in the user, pushing him to unnecessarily renew his
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the client-listed impact indicator does not consider
                            JavaScript, which perhaps a source of more calculations than the DOM in certain
                            situations.</p>

                        <h3>Functional sobriety</h3>
                        <p>After all, the functionality that the least impacts the
                            environment is the one that is not developed.
                            This saves time and money during development, and necessarily does not generate use</p>
                        <p>However, the decision to develop or not a functionality should
                            not be taken lightly.
                            The ideal for making this decision is to bring together a large part of the players on the
                            site (developers, customers, users) and as far as possible to rely on reliable data (use
                            data for example, which
                            could have collected on a previous version of the platform).</p>

                        <h3>Performance indicators</h3>
                        <p>But what is the relationship between performance and eco
                            -design?
                            There are two points of interest.</p>
                        <p>The first is quite obvious, a more efficient application will
                            probably consume fewer resources, or for less long.
                            A way to test this assertion is to measure the consumption of the browser when using the web
                            page with a tool like Powerapi.</p>
                        <p>The second has more impacts, but is less obvious.
                            It is the feeling of obsolescence felt during the use of the site.
                            A long loading time, the delay between the user's inputs and the machine's response, etc.,
                            are phenomena that can push the user to say "well, I would have to renew my equipment".
                            Although it can be attractive to use the latest available features of the latest graphics
                            cards or the latest processors on the market, it should not be forgotten that their use
                            risks arouse frustration in a major part of users who have not
                            These features</p>

                        <h3>Evaluation of the impact of JavaScript</h3>
                        <p>What is JavaScript for on a web page?
                            Validate a form, update the page, execute Ajax requests, undermine cryptocurrency.
                            More and more are possible in JavaScript, but is it useful in the context of all the
                            projects?</p>
                        <p>Even in the utility, we can ask several questions such as
                            the distribution of calculations between the customer and the server,</p>

                        <h3>The rebound effect</h3>
                        <p>The first example of a rebound effect is that of the James
                            Watt steam engine which was much more economical in coal than the old models with equal
                            performance.
                            Rather than a drop in coal consumption, the gain in efficiency and the greater use of the
                            steam engine to cause a constant increase in the use of coal.</p>
                        <p>This example is present from everywhere: a purchase of an LED
                            bulb which consumes less leads to less vigilance on its use, 4G allows faster download
                            (therefore less expensive for infrastructure) so we download more, etc.</p>
                        <p>We must therefore remain vigilant for a progress not followed
                            by a change of habit which counterbalances the savings it allows.</p>
